        <div class="subheading mb-5">Fashion Model </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I had started my modeling journey when I was 16 in my photography class my sophomore year. I had learned how to pose and work with the camera as well as many different people directing me to pose certain ways. I had quickly adapted to this and take pride in my ability to adapt to new things right away. I have modeled for pacsun many times and have a good relationship witht there team.I have a portfolio that displays my diversity as a model and showcases the potential for many different photos.<br><br>

        The reason I decided to become a model was because of the relationship I had with my body.When I was a younger, I had a very hard relationship with my body and hated the way that I looked. I learned how to love myself and learned so much about body positivity. I know that there are many other people out there who had and has delt with the same feelings that I felt. I used to hate taking photos but now I stand in front of that camera hoping to inspire others to love themselves and there own bodies.<br><br>

        Some interesting facts about me is that I like to exercise daily as well as meditating because I feel that taking care of yourself physically and mentally are both equally important things to do. I also love exploring because I want to see as much of the world as I can because I want to explore and experience as much as I can in my lifetime. I am also a stylist which I got started by styling my friends who asked me to help them when I was in high school. I also am a big foodie where I like to travel to restaurants I have never heard of in order to try new foods I never had before.
